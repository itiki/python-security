The center aims at developing technologies, computational methods as well as experimental approaches for analysis of the mammalian genome for non-coding RNAs in relation to (inflammatory) diseases. The center will focus on developing these technologies to exploit them and the findings in relation to diabetes. The center consists of a number of national and international partners, with the core located at the Faculty for Health and Medical Sciences of University of Copenhagen.
The people in the center cover a range of expertises including computational biology, RNA bioinformatics, molecular models in diabetes, RNA biology, animal models, functional genomics and high-throughput sequence analysis.

PhyloQFold is a program for Bayesian sampling of evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. It is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).  PhyloQFold is en enhancement of McQFold.
G. Doose, D. Metzler (2012) "Bayesian Sampling of evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots" Bioinformatics, to appear.
Please report all bugs in PhyloQFold to the developers of the program, Gero Doose and Dirk Metzler (e-mail addresses are given in the README accompanying the program).
The R file McQFold_param.R shows how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) can be applied to fit the paramters of the SCFG used in McQFold and PhyloQFold to given RNA secondary structures with pseudo-knots. It is assumed that secondary structures used as input for the estimation procedure are independent realizations of the stochastic model. This means that from each class of homologous RNA sequences you should select one representative our a consensus structure. (In our R file we show examples with simulated data.) If you want to apply the ABC method given in our R file (also if you have real data), you first need to compile the C++ program qsimul.cc (e.g. with g++ -o qsimul qsimul.cc -O2), which simulates RNA secondary structures with pseudo-knots according to the grammar model, and you need to have the abc package installed in R.

MXSCARNA (Multiplex Stem Candidate Aligner for RNAs) is a multiple alignment tool for RNA sequences using progressive alignment based on pairwise structural alignment algorithm of SCARNA.
This software is fast enough for large scale analyses, while the accuracies of the alignments are better than or comparable with the existing algorithms which are computationally much more expensive in time and memory.

The mfold web server is one of the oldest web servers in computational molecular biology.
It has been in continuous operation since the fall of 1995 when it was introduced at Washington University's School of Medicine.
It operated at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from October 2000 to November 5, 2010, when it was relocated to the RNA Institute web site.
As of the relocation date, an article describing it that was published in the first web server issue of Nucleic Acids Research in July 2003 had been cited 2893 times.
In October 2005, in-cites ranked this article number 3 in a list of 103 "super hot papers" in science published since 2003.

For several decades, free energy minimization methods have been the dominant strategy for single sequence RNA secondary structure prediction. More recently, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) have emerged as an alternative probabilistic methodology for modeling RNA structure. Unlike physics-based methods, which rely on thousands of experimentally-measured thermodynamic parameters, SCFGs use fully-automated statistical learning algorithms to derive model parameters. Despite this advantage, however, probabilistic methods have not replaced free energy minimization methods as the tool of choice for secondarystructure prediction, as the accuracies of the best current SCFGs have yet to match those of the best physics-based models.
CONTRAfold is a novel secondary structure prediction method based on conditional log-linear models (CLLMs), a flexible class of probabilistic models which generalize upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and feature-rich scoring. By incorporating most of the features found in typical thermodynamic models, CONTRAfold achieves the highest single sequence prediction accuracies to date, outperforming currently available probabilistic and physics-based techniques. Our result thus closes the gap between probabilistic and thermodynamic models, demonstrating that statistical learning procedures provide an effective alternative to empirical measurement of thermodynamic parameters for RNA secondary structure prediction.

SimulFold 1.0 is a computer program for co-estimating an RNA structure including pseudo-knots, a multiple-sequence alignment and an evolutionary tree, given a set of evolutionarily related RNA sequences as input. In other words, you give SimulFold an initial alignment of RNA sequences as input and it will predict a consensus RNA structure which may include pseudo-knots while simultaneously estimating the sequence alignment and the evolutionary tree relating the RNA sequences. This means, in particular, that the input alignment need not be a manually curated alignment of high quality. SimulFold employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo in order to sample from the joint posterior distribution of RNA structures, alignments and trees. A post-processing step is then used to cluster the sampled RNA structures into one RNA structure.


http://www.major.iric.ca/MC-Pipeline/
The MC-Fold | MC-Sym pipeline is a web-hosted service for RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction. The pipeline means that the input sequence to MC-Fold outputs secondary structures that are direct input to MC-Sym, which outputs tertiary structures.


http://phmmts.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/
This page provides an implementation of the "pair hidden Markov models on tree structures (PHMMTSs)", which is an extension of the
"pair hidden Markov models (PHMMs)" defined on alignments of trees.
PHMMTS provides a unifying framework and an automata-theoretic model for alignments of trees, structural alignments and pair stochastic context-free grammars.
By structural alignment, we mean a pairwise alignment to align "an unfolded RNA sequence" into "an RNA sequence of known secondary structure".
