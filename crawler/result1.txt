A2ML1##This gene encodes a member of the alpha-macroglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein acts as an inhibitor for several proteases, and has been reported as the p170 antigen recognized by autoantibodies in the autoimmune disease paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP; PMID: 20805888). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]##A2ML1 (Alpha-2-Macroglobulin-Like 1) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with A2ML1 include noonan syndrome 1 and paraneoplastic pemphigus. GO annotations related to this gene include serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity and peptidase inhibitor activity. An important paralog of this gene is CD109.##Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique trapping mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the bait region which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase (By similarity). Displays inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin, papain, thermolysin, subtilisin A and, to a lesser extent, elastase but not trypsin. May play an important role during desquamation by inhibiting extracellular proteases.##same

A1CF##Mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA undergoes site-specific C to U deamination, which is mediated by a multi-component enzyme complex containing a minimal core composed of APOBEC-1 and a complementation factor encoded by this gene. The gene product has three non-identical RNA recognition motifs and belongs to the hnRNP R family of RNA-binding proteins. It has been proposed that this complementation factor functions as an RNA-binding subunit and docks APOBEC-1 to deaminate the upstream cytidine.
